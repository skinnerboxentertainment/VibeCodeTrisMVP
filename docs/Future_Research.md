# Future Research Areas for VibeCoding

Based on the insights and capabilities developed during the VibeCodeTris project, the following broad concepts are identified as promising avenues for future research and expansion of the VibeCoding methodology:

---

### 1. Advanced Procedural Generation

*   **Focus:** Moving beyond current procedural audio to explore more sophisticated real-time generative systems.
*   **Specific Areas:**
    *   **WebGPU Shaders:** Researching frameworks and best practices for real-time procedural graphics using WebGPU to create dynamic and visually rich experiences.
    *   **Algorithmic Music Composition:** Investigating advanced techniques for generating more varied, complex, and emotionally resonant soundscapes through code, potentially integrating machine learning for musical intelligence.
    *   **Procedural Content Generation (PCG):** Exploring PCG for game elements beyond audio and visuals, such as level design or narrative elements, to enhance replayability and dynamic content.

### 2. AI-Native Development & Tooling

*   **Focus:** Enhancing the AI's role in the development lifecycle, moving towards more autonomous and creatively assistive capabilities.
*   **Specific Areas:**
    *   **LLM-Driven Development:** Researching how AI agents can autonomously perform tasks like writing and running comprehensive tests, refactoring code, or even generating entire feature implementations from high-level prompts.
    *   **Sophisticated "Jammer"-Style Tools:** Developing more advanced interactive tools (like the Tone Jammer) that leverage AI to suggest creative variations, optimize parameters, and provide real-time feedback for design decisions across various domains (visuals, gameplay, audio).
    *   **AI for Code Analysis & Optimization:** Exploring AI models that can analyze codebase patterns, identify performance bottlenecks, suggest architectural improvements, and ensure adherence to best practices.

### 3. Synesthetic Design Principles

*   **Focus:** Deepening the integration of sensory experiences to create more immersive and emotionally resonant interactive media.
*   **Specific Areas:**
    *   **Sensory Integration in Interactive Media:** Researching formal principles and psychological effects of synesthesia to create tighter, more meaningful links between audio, visuals, and haptics.
    *   **Emotional Resonance through Procedural Design:** Investigating how dynamically generated content can be tuned to evoke specific emotional responses in players, adapting to their performance and game state.
    *   **Cross-Modal Interaction Design:** Exploring new input and output paradigms that leverage multiple senses simultaneously, potentially leading to novel forms of gameplay and user experience.
